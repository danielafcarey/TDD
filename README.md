## Synopsis
Implement a prefix trie data structure to store a data set of words and various methods to traverse and/or manipulate that data set. 

## Methods
* Use `insert()` to add words individually.
* Use `populate()` to add a data set.
* Use `suggest()` to return an array of words that include the string you pass in as an argument.
* Use `delete()` to remove words from your trie.
* Use `count()` to return the number of words in your trie.
* Use `select()` to upvote a returned word so it appears at the beginning of your suggestions array.
